KOB Utility  | Actual



# Background Context
KochiOrgBook Utility is a community first initiative driven by Wipro to build digital identity and privacy for all citizens and entities within a jurisdiction. The consortium for KochiOrgBook will comprise of organizations / associations within a jurisdiction who can build and offer digital services that are aligned with the ToIPâ€™s dual stack.

This initiative is driven with the help of -
   * Managed Service Providers - help in conceptualizing and implementing the use cases for this utility [Wipro , Kerala Blockchain Academy, Cochin University of Science and Technology]
   * Community of developers - design and build use cases for the utility through crowd sourcing initiatives
   * Associations - define and validate implementation of use case
   * Service Providers - define and validate implementation of digital identity services

The KochiOrgBook Utility is intended to serve organizations / associations that desire to participate in digital trust ecosystems and require an enterprise grade governance framework that will:

   * Enforce permissioned-writes with contractual instruments that will conform to privacy regulations such as GDPR.
   * Maintain financial sustainability of the consortium members without the use of cryptographic tokens.
   * Establish a governing board so that no single organization owns the Identity Utility Network.
   * Require adherence to specified open standards and protocols.


# Pertinent Concepts

   * Self-sustainability: Enable participating organizations / associations to offer digital services in a financial sustainable manner.
   * Self-governed: As a decentralized public service provider, the Utility must be governed as a legal entity with a transparent governing model.
   * Agnostic of underlying network: Enable hosting the utility on any digital identity network without being constraint on the underlying blockchain framework.
   * Scalable digital service offering: 
     * Issue 10 million credentials for the city of Kochi at the lowest cost
     * Build digital services offering leveraging verifiable credential exchange capability

# User Stories:
1. Basic verification services which can be combined to offer specific digital identity services.

     Today email id and phone numbers are the most shared information of an individual or business entity for communication purpose. Though this is a public information, often these are misused for phishing attempts and often individuals do fall for such attempts resulting in financial losses. 
     
     This use case is focused on offering basic verification services like email verification, phone verification services etc. which could then be bundled along with other services for offering customized digital identity services on KOB network.
 
2. Engaging and availing services from Doctors based on their specializations and qualifications
    #### Association to be onboarded: Indian Medical Association (Kochi chapter)
    It is essential to identify and consult the qualified doctor before proceeding with any major medical procedures. Today we need to depend on leading hospitals to identify these qualified doctors and leverage their consulting services. This may take time and may not be feasible in all cases. 
    
    This use case is focused on enabling a citizen of the city of Kochi to get a digital proof that the doctor is qualified in the specific medical area and engage with them for availing their consulting services.
 
3. Engaging lawyers who are qualified to handle specific cases
    #### Association to be onboarded: Bar Council of India (Kochi High Court Chapter)
    It is quite difficult to identity lawyers who are specialized in specific types of cases from public information as only their name and qualifications are made available. All lawyers may not be able to offer legal consultation services which makes it difficult for a citizen to approach the right lawyer without connections. This could take time and may impact the ability of an individual to contest legal claims at court efficiently.
    
    This use case is focused on enabling a citizen of the city of Kochi to verify that the Lawyer is qualified to handle or offer legal consultation on specific types of cases in a most efficient and trustworthy manner.
    
4.	Availing Driving License test by sharing proofs for eligibility 
    #### Organization to be onboarded: Regional Transport Office (Kochi)
    Any individual will need to furnish a set of credentials to prove his/her eligibility to apply for a driving license test. It does take time and the individual will need to put in effort to collate such credential information and submit the same while applying for the driving license test.  The RTO department will then need to verify these credentials manually before granting permission for driving license test and scheduling the same for the candidate.
    
    This use case is focused on enabling a citizen to present digital proofs to take up driving license test leveraging capabilities of verifiable credentials and increase efficiency of the process.
    
    
5. Creating student credentials for applying admission to external Universities   
    #### Organization to be onboarded: Universities and Educational Institutions (Kochi)
    Often a student will have to share multiple credential information for applying admission to external universities. The student would need to apply and secure many of these credentials from different source independently. Not every student may be well versed with the formalities involved this and this results in students incurring delays and cost for securing all the required credentials for applying to external Universities. Lack of transparency in the process also causes some students to miss out on the requesting credentials in specific format which forces them to miss out on apply for admissions.
    
    This use case is focused on enabling a student to collect all required digital credentials /proofs and submit them in a timely manner leveraging a workflow which offers transparency, enhance efficiency, and reduces cost to apply for admissions.
